              Discover the mysteries of psychology and be one step ahead of the game by understanding nonverbal communication.
             <br>
             <br>
              <b>Prologue to Body Language:</b>
              <br>
              I'm sure you've heard of this term before, but to be precise, in simple terms - Body language is a series of conscious and unconscious movements which we use to express our emotions or attitude to those around us. It is certainly a type of non-verbal communication. The problem emerges when it comes to how these subtle movements are interpreted by other people. 
              Are others able to interpret your movements in the same way that you do? Are you even sending out the correct message in a comprehensible manner? Also, it's crucial to understand that not every signal we send out is intentional and that's where the unconscious mind comes into play. Body Language is an unorganized notion. 
              Non-verbal communication was the way we communicated before we could talk like we do today. Gestures with head, finger movements, hand signals are different types of non-verbal correspondence, and they worked.
              
             </p>


               <p>
                <b>How to Read People?</b>
                <br>
Do you realize that the piece of being a human is understanding implicit signs made by individuals around us? This aids us not only to unravel how they feel and their opinion but additionally about - what they really are? The majority of individuals who wish to decipher non-verbal and verbal signs have a desire to understand others deeply rather than simply the regular veils will be an individualâ€™s greatest set forth.
To read people, you must be able to let go of your biases, egoism, preconceptions, hatred, and any other baggage that might tamper your judgment. To read someone is not a simple task, whether it's a friend, a classmate, or even a co-worker, you must break down some barriers. Regardless of the fact that our minds are undisputedly brilliant enough, they can still stifle us.

               </p>
               <p>
                <b>Noticing Non-verbal signs</b>
                <br>
                Research reveals that verbal communication accounts for only a part of what we say, with non-verbal clues providing the balance.
                <br>
                <b>Appearance matters</b>
                <br>
                When you notice them, take a note of whether they're suited in a sophisticated, business-themed attire that conveys ambition or a t-shirt and jeans outfit that conveys comfort. Also, take a glance at the accessories they're wearing. All these will assist you in determining the person's motives.
                <br>
                <b>Keep an eye on the posture</b>
                <br>
                Observe if they walk with their head held high or they look to be trembling. Do they make a show of power by putting their chest out, or do they try to walk by unacknowledged? When stressing a point, a person's body leans forward, and when concluding a segment, the body leans backward. The way a person stands also reveals a lot about them.
                <br>
                <b>Actual pointers</b>
                <br>
                The way a person acts can reveal a lot about them. If a person is hiding hands in his/her pockets or gnawing their lips/nails, this signifies that he or she is uncomfortable. 
                <br>
                <b>The manner of speaking</b>
                <br>
                It reveals a lot about how another person feels. People with a loud vocal tone have a confident outlook. However, it's fair to say that a loud tone differs from a powerful one. A low voice tone reflects a person's lack of confidence as well as their uneasiness.
                <br><b>Micro-flash detection</b>
                <br>
                It is very hard to notice these articulations since they simply streak for 1/25th second to be exact. These are veritable articulations, they show up in a second and take a lot of practice to notice and understand these articulations.                                      
              </p>   
              <p>
                  <b>What do eyes portray?</b>
                  <br>
Did you know that eyes express feelings? Yes, that indeed is true! A person's true feelings are portrayed via their eyes. Initiate studying people in your immediate surroundings, notably their eyes. You can figure out if they're annoyed, curious, sad, or happy. Make eye contact while in a conversation; if a person does not make eye contact with you, it implies disengagement or falsehood. If he/she looks down, it indicates that he/she is nervous. When a person lies, their blinking rate rises.                            
                        
              </p>                              
            
            <blockquote class="mb-50">
              The eyes are the gateways of the spirit.
            </blockquote>

           
            <p class="mb-50">
              <b>Why must we concentrate on expressions?</b>
              <br>
              Assume that you were eating curry but it tasted very salty and the twisted expression on your face communicates. It tells the other person that the curry is not good and is preferred not to taste it! These are impulsive reactions that are extremely important in communication.
              <br>
              <b>What does the direction of the eyes anticipate?</b>
              <br>
              During a conversation, looking up and to the right indicates that the person is lying while looking up and to the left indicates that he or she is speaking the truth. The reason for this is that when people recall memories, they look to the left and upwards, whereas when they use their imagination to create a narrative, they look to the right and upwards.
              
            </p>

              <p>
                <b>How to disclose whether the person is lying or not?</b>
                <br>
There has been no eye contact. Touching their eyes and mouth indicates that the person is deceiving you. Moreover, strange gestures and increased rate of breathing convey the same. There is a time lag between their words and gestures when they communicate. When telling a story, the body appears to be more expressive, but if a person limits their hand gestures and feels awkward, you can conclude that he/she is lying. Typically, liars will freeze in order to avoid presenting too much emotional body language.

              </p>
              
              <p class="mb-50">
                Remember that when a person is genuine, his or her words, gestures, and emotions all match.
                Assume you received a surprise on your birthday and your face shows the emotion of surprise, your hands are on your mouth, and you say "OMG!" all at the same time. Conversely, when asked if someone's food is tasty or not? The person is considered to be faking his/her emotion if he/she replies "It's delicious!" with a delayed smile.
                
              </p>    
              <blockquote class="mb-50">
                The craft of perusing individuals through non-verbal communication isn't a science; there are no guidelines, constraints or conventions.
