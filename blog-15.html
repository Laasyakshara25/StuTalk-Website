            <p>
              There was a point in my life, as a teenager, when I had no clue of what I was doing or 
              even what I wanted to do. To wake up each day and go about my mundane routine of school, 
              and back home, which almost never felt tiring or boring. This went on for about 2 years of my adulthood as well, 
              when I was finally presented with time on a silver platter. I had time to really think, to realize that there 
              are things that make me happy and hobbies I want to finesse. I explored aspects of living my present perfectly, 
              so that I don’t end up with regrets when I look back, ten years from. I read this book named "Digital Minimalism" 
              by Cal Newport and it completely changed my perspective of productivity. 
              </p>

               <p>
                While I didn’t really want to dwell on the fact that social media rips off 
                our autonomy since I am not a very active user of social media, 
                I did like how this book came as a blessing in disguise when most of the world was lonely. 
                It had points about the importance of solitude for the human brain for it to function to 
                its full potential. In solitude I realized that I thought more about people and the time I had 
                spent with them, I actually realized what missing someone actually meant. Time presented itself 
                as the driving force to me so that I could be more productive and give time to myself for exploring 
                those aspects of 20 years of my life, that I probably would have ignored just by complaining about not 
                having enough time. The easiest way to live a happy life is to actually find the real meaning of happiness 
                and happiness being a very subjective emotion, we actually have to spend time with ourselves in order to 
                find our happiness. I want to be a better person and that is where I spent my time during the quarantine. 
               </p>

               
               <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                <img
                  class="img-fluid img-blog mb-50"
                  src="images/blog/blog-15-3.png"
                  alt="image"
                />
              </div>






           
              <p>
                I wanted to explore uncomfortable human emotions and feel them, 
                I wanted to feel stronger and more accomplished. Hence, I ended up 
                making a routine that could help me get the most of my 24 hours. While doing the tasks 
                I had assigned for myself I stopped texting back to people with whom I was stuck in a text loop. 
                My old self would have felt guilty and scared about losing a text friend but now I understood that a 
                true friend isn’t bound by the limits of texts and the minutes I took to reply back. I refined my skills 
                in writing, poetry, cooking by taking up the responsibility of making breakfast every day, singing; though 
                that is still a work in progress, and my beloved photography. As I was spending time for myself I was observing more, 
                I observed seasons change though it is so abnormal to not notice that but, who are we kidding?  We never have time. 
                I observed trees, leaves, and colors that fascinated me and inspired me to write better, to take pictures better, 
                and eventually took me to the path of finding my dream. I have tiny bursts of happiness when I take walks 
                around my house now, how I would dread the sun in summer and how I found the cold winter breeze to be calming.

              The most basic need to feel human is to have our autonomy

            <p class="mb-50">
              Turning 20 was a big deal for me because I had this strong voice in 
              my head telling me to do something better, to have a dream that could help me 
              scratch things off my bucket list and I felt overwhelmed on my birthday, 
              though it's another thing that I ended up sick. But I was grateful that 
              I had a voice in me, which keeps telling me not to give up, not just yet. 
              I found peace and portions of my life that I would have never found, 
              I became more perceptive to people around me and I got to know them better. 
              We all needed this time, not to feel lonely but to be grateful to the sunrise, the rain, food, shelter, 
              and all those mere things we ignored.
            </p>
            
            
            
             
      
              
              
            <p>Happiness is not just in what we get, it is in how we get it. 
                We all need definite goals and strong dreams to survive, we need a 
                purpose to wake up each day so that tomorrow we wake up to something better. 
                I felt embarrassed to have a confused face every time someone asked what I aspired to be. 
                I am glad I have left that part of me behind. I hope we find time for our thoughts, those 
                thoughts that are labeled as loneliness and anxiety triggers, they are not those things, 
                they are your thoughts which are completely not influenced by someone else, be proud of them and 
                let them teach you once in a while, I am sure we all will start loving each other more.
