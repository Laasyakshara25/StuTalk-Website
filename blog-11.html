              The Armenian Genocide dismantled a lot of families and cultures of Armenian Christians 
              who were living in the Ottoman Empire. It is widely believed that the massacre first started on April 24, 
              1915 when 235 – 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders were arrested, deported, 
              and eventually, the majority of whom were murdered. This began the tragedy which caused 
              the deaths of more than a million people over a time period of 9 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Armenian families usually used to consist of extended family units like aunts, 
              uncles, and grandparents. The Armenian religion, the traditions, and rituals in 
              their culture played a huge part in helping Armenians around the world hold on to 
              their identity and heritage. Only a few Armenians live in present Turkey, while around 
              3 million Armenians live in Armenia and more than 2 million Armenians live in Russia 
              and the United States. Now, Armenians are scattered across the world. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-50">
              During World War 1, the Armenian Genocide was carried out by the Ottoman government. 
              A special committee called Committee of Union and Progress passed the Temporary Law of Deportation 
              which gave the military a right to deport any person that it thought was a threat to national 
              security. The Armenians would then be exiled and marched to the deserts of Syria. All the Armenian 
              people including children, pregnant women, and old aged persons were forced to walk on the journey 
              of more than 60 days in scorching heat while giving them only limited food and water and purposefully 
              holding back supplies. Even healthy men and women could not complete the journey as the army and forces 
              never gave enough time for the people to rest and used to periodically kill people who were not able to 
              keep up. Many journalists and missionaries documented the journey whenever possible while trying to give 
              them food and water. 
            </p>
            
            <blockquote class="mb-50">
              A traveling businessman Auguste Berneau said “It was like passing through hell” in 
              August of 1916. Over a million Armenians are believed to have died or massacred during the Genocide.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Women were raped and abused mercilessly. 8-10-year-old girls were raped in front of other 
              deportees and subsequently shot since they could not walk as a consequence of the abuse. 
              Many journalists could see half-naked women lie on the side of the street dead and children 
              who were left behind by parents near bushes completely starved. The only way to get some food 
              or water for the whole family was to bribe the soldiers, but all the wealth and possessions of 
              the deportees were looted. The few who managed to save some money used to hide it in their bodies 
              so that the soldiers may not find it when they tried to abuse them.</p>

              <p>Pregnant women were not given 
              any time to rest and were forced to walk the journey even just a day after giving birth which would 
              eventually lead to their deaths. Many pregnant women used to cut open their wombs to remove their
               baby, but they would eventually die because of exhaustion and internal bleedings. In the Armenian d
               ense places, after the attacks, the Muslims would take all the possessions and used to eliminate 
               men to destroy the carriers of Armenian blood. Few would rape and abuse the women and children 
               while others married the young girls and assimilated them into Turkish households. 
             </p>
             <p> 
              Even before the World War 1, during 1894-1896 when Sultan Abdul Hamid II was the ruler of 
              the Ottoman Empire, he was nicknamed The Bloody Sultan when he created a separate military 
              unit called Hamidiye, which consisted of armed Kurdish irregulars to “deal with the Armenians 
              as they wished”. During the time, officials provoked the local public and instigated disruption 
              to protest the high taxes. To counter this, the Hamidiye unit was sent to these villages and 
              unarmed people were massacred. Many countries condemned this and forced the Sultan to change 
              their policies, dismantle the structure of Hamidiye, and grant basic rights and equality to the 
              Armenians. The Ottoman Empire signed a treaty but the policies in it were never enforced. 
              To protest this, thousands of Armenians came together and asked for the implementation of the 
              promised reforms but the police broke up the rally, and in a few days massacres of Armenian people 
              started happening around the region. This later came to be known as the Hamidian Massacres which 
              took the lives of over a hundred thousand Armenian people.
